Web Assembly is a low-level language. It is like assembly language. Till now, browsers could execute javascript code. Now, they can execute web assembly code also. Advantage is that we can write the front code of web application in C, Rust or any other language. We only need a compiler that compiles that code into web assembly code. The browser will fetch it and execute.

So now, you do not need to know javascript to write front code of web application.
